  abstract = 	 {This paper introduces DeepBach, a graphical model aimed at modeling polyphonic music and specifically hymn-like pieces. We claim that, after being trained on the chorale harmonizations by Johann Sebastian Bach, our model is capable of generating highly convincing chorales in the style of Bach. DeepBach’s strength comes from the use of pseudo-Gibbs sampling coupled with an adapted representation of musical data. This is in contrast with many automatic music composition approaches which tend to compose music sequentially. Our model is also steerable in the sense that a user can constrain the generation by imposing positional constraints such as notes, rhythms or cadences in the generated score. We also provide a plugin on top of the MuseScore music editor making the interaction with DeepBach easy to use.}

abstract="Rice has become one of the largest and most widely cultivated food crops in the world. Nevertheless, there is a significant probability that high amounts of salt, especially at the stage of seedling development, would have a detrimental effect on rice output. As a result, it is critical to quickly discover and develop salinity-tolerant rice crop types, particularly at the stage of seedling development, to prevent a decrease in rice output. Expertise from humans is required for the categorization of visual signals and the conventional way of a standard assessment system for identifying rice crop salinity stress. It's time demanding and prone to mistakes, both of which may lead to inaccurate classification. Recent developments in deep learning and transfer training have opened the road for the automated categorization of a wide range of agricultural jobs, from the detection of plant diseases and pests to the identification of weeds and invasive species. The lack of plant-domain-specific pre-trained models and the limited number of available datasets remain significant obstacles to agricultural automation. We use the AgriNet dataset, a database of 850 image graphs of farms and agricultural settings. The work shows the need for a deep learning developed model over the conventional way of measuring rice crop sensitivity to salt stress throughout the seedling stage to detect and categorize stress caused by salinity in the seedling stage of rice using field images. Thus, we use one of the most advanced deep learning approaches, VGG 16, VGG 19, Resnet 50, Resnet 100, exception, Resnet 50V2, Inception V3, MobileNetV2, DenseNet121, and ResNet101V2 which was built in Python's Jupyter Notebook, to construct the classification model. To further demonstrate the need for a computer-based classification system for salinity estimation that could be used as a tool for automating the classification process for rice development to aid scientists and farmers in the rice crop management system, the model can classify rice seedling images in accordance to the scores as Grade1, Grade3, Grade5, Grade7, and Grade9.",

abstract="Uncovering hidden patterns and relationships in knee OA data using machine learning algorithms can be incredibly useful for predicting illness progression and developing more effective treatments. By analyzing large amounts of data, machine learning algorithms can identify patterns and relationships that might not be immediately apparent to human researchers. This can help us better understand the mechanisms behind knee OA and identify potential targets for treatment. By developing more potent treatments, we may be able to slow the progression of the disease and improve patient outcomes. The knee osteoarthritis dataset information was initially acquired from Kaggle and the information on knee osteoarthritis is processed before model training. The study aims to develop and apply advanced machine learning methods, such as deep learning techniques like CNN-SVM, Mobilenet v2, Resnet152v2, Resnet 50, and EfficientnetB5, to analyze knee OA data and develop accurate prediction models for early diagnosis and prognosis. The study evaluates the performance of these models on a dataset of individuals with knee OA to determine their efficacy and accuracy.",
